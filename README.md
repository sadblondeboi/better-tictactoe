# better-tictactoe

One of the first projects I've done in Vue.js, it isn't finished yet because I didn't want to spend more time on polishing it. Basic functionalities are all done I think. 

Project was created to practice Vue.js and I'm pretty sure it has some bad code and bad practices all around the place but I'm pretty proud that it even works at all.

I had no backend (I'd like to create it some day though) so I used VueX to simulate it. You can add players to the instance with a simple form. 

I'm planning on adding some more functionalities so it looks more professional:
- icons for X and O
- a restart button
- counter (how many times a specific player has won)
- scoreboard
- probably something else too, don't know yet
